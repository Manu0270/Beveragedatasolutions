                        <h3>Beverage Suppliers Need Their Depletion Data</h3>
                        <p>As an importer or supplier, you need to know how your product is selling at the Retail Account Level (RAD). However, since in most cases, your customer is the distributor in their network, how can you tell who is buying your product? The sales through the distributors are usually called depletions and without the ability to gather and analyze this information, you have very little insight to a major part of your business.</p>
                        <p>Most Distributors produce depletion data from their ERP systems or a separate Vendor Depletion Reporting System. They will usually include sales by product line, item, size. Some will also provide inventory levels of your products and SKU’s.</p>

                        <h3>Different Distributors, Different Formats</h3>
                        <p>The good news is the information is available, but how will you collect and make sense out of it? The reports will come in from each distributor in their format with the own unique coding for item numbers, descriptions, pack sizes, etc. Some will be in bottles and some will be in cases.  Putting this information into a meaningful format and scrubbing the data is a time consuming job.  To add to the work, you may get this data in spreadsheets or PDF reports.</p>
                        <p>Ignoring the need to understand this part of your business is not an option. Making it a job for the internal staff is one way to go. You can have your sales team trying to get this information and cut and paste it into spreadsheets or you can have them out driving your sales and building your brand. The solution depends on your desire to work on your core business or do part time data processing.</p>

                        <h3>Finally, a Solution to Your Depletion Problems (Beverage Industry)</h3>
                        <p>Our Depletion Management services will take this entire job off your hands and give you the data and reporting to understand your business. Because this is one of our core business functions, you will get your information very quickly since we have a team of people processing the data as soon as it is available.</p>
                        <p>This will give you not only the data but the information you need. How are you doing compared to last month, last year? Are you getting the on premise sales you want? How many new Accounts were opened with your products? Are your promotions giving you the results you need?</p>

                            Our Beverage Data Solutions provide several levels of service depending on the business model you prefer.
                            Below are the services available.
                        </p>

                        <ul class="pl-3">
                            <li>Collect the data on your behalf for processing</li>
                            <li>
                                Process the data – in all forms including excel, text files, pdf files to the designed output format.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Process the data to a standard output so you can easily perform analysis across your business even when the data received is in various formats
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Convert the data to standard formats like cases or case equivalent based on your instructions
                            </li>
                            <li>Balance the data to ensure accuracy and format requirements</li>
                            <li>Transmit the data to whomever you designate (i.e. BDN)</li>
                            <li>Provide status information to you</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>BDN File Processing</h3>
                        <p>
                            If you are using Beverage Data Network (BDN) for your data collection, the data format requirements can be difficult to accomplish without technical resources. If you are not meeting these requirements it will cause delays processing your
                            information, may reduce the data available to you and potentially increase your cost.
                            We have partnered with BDN to process the data to their precise standards. Our standard level of service
                            is to have the data transmitted to BDN within 48 hours of receiving the data file. In most cases, we will have
                            the data processed in the first week after the close of the month. This will give you a much faster turnaround
                            of the BDN data for your analysis. All this can be accomplished at a much lower cost than manually
                            collecting the information and trying to format the data.

                        <p class="mb-3">Whether you are a beverage distributor or supplier, a business intelligence software can help you in more ways than one. If you are looking for a resource that can take your data, analyze it, then give you an in depth look on what is really going on with your company, then you are in the right place. Our BI software, Answergen offers a wide array of tools that lets you break down your company in multiple different ways so that you can track sales, depletion reports, distributors, and other options. Many companies use Nielsen Beverage Data Network (BDN) to submit and process their data which require specific requirements. We can help you collect the data to be submitted directly to BDN, format it for you, then analyze that data for your specific use.</p>

                            <h3>Maximize Your Beverage Sales</h3>
                            <p>When your company gets larger, it can be more difficult to track sales, see what kind of people are buying your product, and where. These difficulties apply to most large companies in the beverage industry, but can go unnoticed for long periods of time. Knowing this kind of information can assist you in allocating your resources properly, to ensure optimum sales in the right locations. Every day that goes by and your company is not optimized, you can be risking an accumulation of sales. Lets put it this way, if you know where the majority of your sales are, you can proportionately allocate your marketing and advertising budget to that specific location. If you are splitting up your advertising budget evenly throughout all of your sales locations, you may be wasting time and resources doing so if that location is not the one that is primarily buying your wine or beer.</p>

                            <h3>BI Solutions for the Beverage Industry</h3>
                            <p>Our BI solutions for the beverage industry not only optimize your sales, they save you time, energy and money. Selecting a specific person to handle all of your data collection, analysis and reporting as a side task seems like a great idea, right? Unfortunately this is likely wrong for multiple reasons. Is this employee collecting the data? When I say that, I mean, are they making 100% sure that every distributor is submitting their data in the correct format? If the answer is no, the Beverage Data Solutions might have a simple solution to your problem. Not only do we collect all of the data from your distributors in a timely, efficient manner, but we format it for you, just in case they don’t do it right. This alleviates the tasks from your hands and guarantees that it is being done right. Many companies in the wine and spirits industry often ignore their in-depth analytics,  or make it a lower priority because they feel that it does not hurt the company to wait on their decision to use analytical tools. This is an inaccurate assumption, because everyday that you are not meeting your maximum amount of sales, you are in fact hurting your company.</p>
